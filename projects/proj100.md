Project 100 was a fundraising project led by engineering students at Kalani Highschool, with the aim to raise money for future project costs. 

The project asked for a design, manufacturing, marketing and selling of 100 Christmas ornaments by a 2 month time frame. Me and my group of 4 students designed a layered ornament with clear acrylic that allowed for a design similar to a mixture between snowglobes and ornaments. Inside were sand, with cute laser cutouts of a sea turtle and a few picks of seashell. The ornament also came with an option add on of custom letters to stick onto the ornament to spell out custom names, words, and phrases to make it special for loved ones. 

With a total budget of $200, we were able to make 105 ornaments and sold all 105 at the cost of $8 dollars per piece, making a net profit of around 600 dollars for the Kalani Highschool engineering department.
