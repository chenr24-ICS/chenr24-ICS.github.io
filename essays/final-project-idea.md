## Everything Toilet Map

## Overview
The problem: As an essential function of the human body, defecation and urination plays a vital role in every college student's day to day life. Students, especially incoming freshmen and exchange students that are new to campus, rarely take the time to fully familiarize themselves with campus and the different amenities. One of which commonly missed are the restrooms. Restrooms are everywhere on campus, but it can be overwhelming to find the right one or the nearest one in the case of an emergency, causing students to get lost and confused..

The solution: The Everything Toilet Map is a solution that allows students and the public to access critical information regarding every restroom at UH Manoa. Closing time, maintenance schedule, gender, and even cleanliness rating. The app would be designed to have the information to derive from public assessment, thus calling for user profiles that allow for reviews and editing of the page for the bathrooms.

## Approach
We will approach this problem using the nextjs template as a basis for our design. We will customize the site to include a map of UH Manoa which lists the spots that have restrooms. The admin will be able to designate a spot that has a restroom in an add page. This will include the building and floor or similar information. 

## Use Cases

Our use cases will not require user accounts for use, allowing them to view the map and write reviews regardless of account. We will also allow admins to create new points on maps.

Overall our use cases will follow these guidelines:
New or default user goes to landing page, goes to map, finds nearby restrooms
Admin goes to landing page, logs in, edits map
User goes to landing page, submits rating
User can view restroom reviews or submit upon viewing one

## Beyond the Basics

After implementing the basic formatting of our app, we have some additional features that can be explored

A status indicator, for whether the toilet is going through repairs or maintenance/cleaning.
Review for user reviews/reply or user rating function
Extending the Map and scope to beyond UH manoa, perhaps Honolulu
