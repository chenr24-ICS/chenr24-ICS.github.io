## Why Software Engineering is so important
I believe software engineering is a very unique form of art. The ability to create a website or an app for users to be able to look and interact with is something I have always admired. 
Everything we see in the digital world can not leave software engineering, from apps to security systems to websites. What I enjoy about software engineering is the permitting of free flow creativity and flexbility, where as long as I have an idea I have a way to make it come to life. 
Another important aspect of software engineering is being able to break down complex problems and design solutions for other people to utilize. 

## My goals and ambitions 
I have always wanted to use Software Engineering to be able to create a software/website that tracks down every single public or private bathroom on Oahu. This project deeply resonates in my heart and goals because I have always faced the problem of not knowing where the nearest restroom is while I am out in public.
To think that I have this problem all time, also gave me the idea that the chances others face this issue is great as well. Through the power of software engineering, my dreams of creating this bathroom tracker software will come true and provide a service to my community in which I value so much. 
To be able to help my communnity in such a significant way is something that software engineering can do, which further strengthens my opinion of the beauty in this wonderful artcraft.
