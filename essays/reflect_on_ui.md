## My experience with UI Frameworks
I had a great experience learning and applying css and html into my programming arsena. Personally I believe that HTML is a very sophisticated and flexible language that allowed me to create whatever I wanted to envision. Looking at websites and trying to imitate them was also a great experience as I was able to work on my analytical skills and application of basic html knowledge. Whats more the cherry on top was the use of Bootstrap5 and making websites that pop out with functions and tools that allow for even better flexibility. By recreating websites such as the CDC guidelines for handwashing or Banyan's in Kailua, I was able to gain a sense of direction in which I can apply these skills to outside of school, leading to my next point. 

## My intentions with the skills I learned 
I plan to continue my developement in software/web design by applying the skills I learned from this module to create a website that would eventually hold an online gallery of my photography work I do in my free time. I am super excited with the opportunity as I am now able to not only create a website but also showcase my skills and passion outside of school. 

## Conclusion 
Overall I am super excited to showcase the world what I have learned through this module, and hopefully one day be able to create my own website. I understand the resources that are available to me, and the methods I can utilize to reach that goal, all thanks to my experience through the past week with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap5.
