## The Essence of Design

Design pattern is like a standard format to a house, as well as the base case to a dynamic programming problem. It is a recyclable solution that structures the foundations of your creation that can be altered according to your needs as well. In the essence of designing a software, function, or even a house, there is always standards that must be met everytime for consistency and clarity. Take for an example a house, there would always be a bathroom, a place to put a bed, kitchen, running water + electricty, and so on. This is design pattern, every house would have those basic components for it to be functional; or habitable in the case for a house. This is important because design pattern sets a standard for all similar projects, helping with scalability and maintenance, along with easier understanding by others outside of the project. A consistent effective format also prevents repeating mistakes, the more it is practiced, the more skilled one would be performing the task.
