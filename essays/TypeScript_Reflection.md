## My Experience with Typescript, and What I Aspire to Create

As someone who was relatively new to TypeScript and only knew the name, I came into freeCodeCamp.org feeling nervous.
At first, I was skeptical about learning JavaScript and couldn’t see the connection between the two until I found out that TypeScript was an extension of JavaScript.

JavaScript reminded me of a mixture of Java and the simplicity of Python, which gave me a sense of familiarity and made it easier to get started.
Although I was only introduced to the basics, the simplicity of TypeScript had me questioning what kinds of problems it can solve more easily than other programming languages.

I believe that TypeScript is a great programming language from a software engineering perspective because it allows type checking and error detection.
It is also very convenient since it integrates directly with JavaScript. FreeCodeCamp gave me a wonderful introduction to TypeScript, and I am super excited to add a new language to my arsenal.

Looking ahead, I want to use TypeScript for app development, possibly refining my professional portfolio with projects that reflect my skills and passion.
I also want to build something that combines my photography hobby with TypeScript an app that creates a map of all the places I’ve been and the photos I’ve taken there.
Another project idea I have is a bathroom tracker for Honolulu: from private restrooms in restaurants to public restrooms at beaches, I want to create an app that tracks them all.
The reason is simple during emergencies, I want to take quick action, and TypeScript seems like a great language to use because of its readability and maintainability.
